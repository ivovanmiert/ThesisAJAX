Besides this, the repository contains a folder called 'Feature Build', which contains all files written to create the features for the classification model. 
This repository also contains a folder 'Concatenation', which is a folder which applies all models onto the data, and streamlines the process of handling all data. This folder contains a config file, in which most locations used for folders/files in that folder are defined.

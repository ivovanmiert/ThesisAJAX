This folder contains the code written or edited for the different existing models. 
Each folder has its own README.md file with further information on which file is used for what. 
These folders do not contain the full original code for the models, but only the files written extra to it to make it fit the data of this research. The links at the end of this README are the links to the original github codes. 

Besides these models, the self-designed, written, and trained classification model can be found in the folder 'Team Classification'.

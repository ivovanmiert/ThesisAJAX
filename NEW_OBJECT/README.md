This folder contains the code for transforming the data obtained from the different models, into features used in the classification process. 
In overview/run_base/base.py an object of class Events (as can be found in load_and_work_overview.py) is initialized, in which certain information for the transforming of the data is initialized (concerning field types, kits, and the paths to the data obtained from the models, classification model). This is followed by a call on the function 'instantiate_events', which handles the transforming of obtained data into the features for each event seperately. In the 'instantiate_events' function, first the datapaths concerning that specific event are collected, which is followed by the creation of an EventData event. With the creation of this EventData (general.py) the rest of the transforming is handled). 

The different files in this folder contain the creation of different classes, which all contribute to the feature creation. Descriptions on the class are given at the start of the files.

This folder is about the final classification process of the clips. 
In the file 'example5_overview_balanced_undersampling_01_more_layers_less_features_added_all_5' the loading into the datasets is done, so that these preloaded datasets can be reloaded much quicker for training the different models. This way of preloading and reloading decreased the loading time for the full 130 features from 8 minutes to 45 seconds. 
In the file 'example5_overview_balanced_loaded_different_cl2' the model was build to train, validate and evaluate it. This file was called from the 'overview' folder with certain parameters. Based on these parameters it loads certain datasets and does the training, validating and evaluation with it.

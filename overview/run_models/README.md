This folder contains the scripts used to handle the processing of the different models. Every model has its own folder containing job scripts used to run files in that folder that import 'main' functions of the models from other folders, and handle the input data and output paths of the models. What follows is a short description per folder what can be found:
  - ball_detection: job_ball_detect.job and run_ball_detection.py: This job and file run the detection process of the ball. This is followed by the post-processing of the ball detection as is described in my thesis. This is done by job_ball_post_process.job and run_post_process.py. Besides this, a file is added that was used to delete certain saved ball_detection files because they were saved on the wrong name (remove_wrong_processed.py). This file is not necessary, but was used just a few times.
  - field_localization: 'job_run_keypoints_calibration.job' and its connected python file 'run_keypoints_calibration.py' handle the processing of the field-localization. The 'job_test_keypoints.job' and 'run_keypoints_calibration.py' do this regarding the calibration on the evaluation set. 'chunk_1.json' is an example of how a chunk of data is defined. 
  - pifpaf/player_detection/top_down all consist of a job file and a connected python file that handle the processing of the data on that part of the model.
